    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
    <p>Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. The World Wide Web has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains. In addition to its increasing use in marketing, advertising, and consumer-focused communications, web development has impacted industries including entertainment, government, and commerce.</p>
    <p>Modern web development often involves front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies such as server-side scripting, databases, and web servers. The field continues to evolve with new frameworks, tools, and best practices emerging regularly.</p>
