    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.</p>
    <p>Cloud computing provides companies with the ability to store and process data in third-party data centers. Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. Cloud computing services are provided by several vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others.</p>
    <p>The main service models of cloud computing are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each model provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management, enabling businesses to choose the best fit for their needs.</p>
