    <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>Computer security, cybersecurity, or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things".</p>
    <p>Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support. Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as power distribution, elections, and finance. As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow, organizations are increasingly investing in cybersecurity measures to protect their digital assets and maintain business continuity.</p>
    <p>The field includes practices such as network security, application security, endpoint security, data security, identity management, database and infrastructure security, cloud security, mobile security, disaster recovery and business continuity planning. Cybersecurity professionals use various tools and techniques including firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and security awareness training to protect against threats.</p>
